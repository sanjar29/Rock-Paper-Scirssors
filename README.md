# Rock Paper Scissors [Web](https://simplerockpaperscissorsgame.tiiny.site/)  & Android Game 🪶✂️📄

Hey there. I built a simple and fun "Rock Paper Scissors" game which is available as both a **web app** 🌐 and an **Android app** 📱. Sadly, it is not a two player, you will only be able to play against a bot 🤖 and see if you can outsmart it! The game allows you to select from three choices: **Rock** 🪶, **Paper** 📄, and **Scissors** ✂️, and the bot randomly selects its choice. The game determines the winner based on the classic rules:

- Rock 🪶 beats Scissors ✂️
- Scissors ✂️ beats Paper 📄
- Paper 📄 beats Rock 🪶
